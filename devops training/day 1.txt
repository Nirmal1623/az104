COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE

DATA CENTRE
PHYSICAL SEVRVER & STORAGE


NETWORKING FUNDAMENTALS
IT INFRASTRUCTURE
-> TRADITIONAL-physical way
-> CLOUD-cloud computing
_> HYPERCONVERGED-windows&linux on same machine

CLOUD-INFRASTRUCTURE
server&storage services
database adminstration
end user

virtualization -> allows for more utilization of physical computer hardware
benefits
.resource efficiency
easier managemnet
minimal downtime
faster provisioning

virtualization servers, storage, network, applications

two types of hypervisors
type1 providers->vmware, microsoft hyper-v, red hat, citrix, kvm


MAD(Modern application development)
best way to design, buid and manage cloud software


Monolithic architecture
microservice

event driven architecture
key components -> event producer, router, consumer

NETWORKING
IPV6->128 bit
